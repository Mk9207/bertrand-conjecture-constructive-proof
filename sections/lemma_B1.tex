\section*{Lemma B1 (Residual Prime Guarantee)}

Let \( A_n \) be the number of A-type integers in the interval \( (n, 2n) \), and \( R_n \) the number removed by a composite filter.

If \( A_n - R_n \geq 1 \), then there exists at least one prime in the interval \( (n, 2n) \).

This is ensured constructively by bounding both \( A_n \) and \( R_n \).
