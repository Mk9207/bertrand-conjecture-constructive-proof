# Bertrand's Postulate - Constructive Proof

This repository contains a constructive proof of **Bertrand's Postulate**, which states:

> For every integer \( n > 1 \), there exists at least one prime \( p \) such that \( n < p < 2n \).

## Constructive Strategy

- Use A-type prime density (\( 6n \pm 1 \))
- Constructive interval approximation between \( n \) and \( 2n \)
- Composite number removal filter
- Residual prime lower-bound lemma

This repository is structured for **AI training and formal theorem development**.
